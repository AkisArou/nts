# Native operations: example-led semantics

This is the working revision of the native-operations part of
[native-values-and-resource-flow.md](native-values-and-resource-flow.md).
That document remains design history; its proposed API is not a fixed contract.
ResourceFlow follows native operations and is not implemented by this slice.

## First executable slice: a caller-owned buffer

[The runnable example](../examples/interop/native-buffer/src/main.ts) exposes:

```ts
import type { Ptr, c_uint8 } from "c:types";

export function uppercaseAscii(bytes: Ptr<c_uint8>, length: number): number {
  let changed = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    const byte = bytes[i];
    if (byte >= 97 && byte <= 122) {
      bytes[i] = byte - 32;
      changed++;
    }
  }
  return changed;
}
```

The C driver owns an ordinary byte buffer and can stream a file through this
function. File I/O remains in C in this example. Its purpose is to establish
native storage access before choosing the aggregate and allocation APIs.

## Semantics implemented in this slice

- `Ptr<T>` is a native address whose scalar element layout is `T`. The existing
  `c_*` scalar brands select the C spelling, signedness, and element width.
  `Opaque<"Tag">` remains an address to a foreign struct whose layout is not
  available. It permits passing the handle but does not permit dereferencing.
  Both use the same compiler pointer representation with different pointees.
- `p[i]` indexes elements, not bytes. Reads project native scalars into TS
  `number`. Writes convert a TS number into the declared element representation.
  Arithmetic remains ordinary number arithmetic, including for 64-bit integer
  elements: this API does **not** promise exact arbitrary `int64_t`/`uint64_t`
  arithmetic. An exact-integer API needs a separate decision before it ships.
- Finite fractional writes to integers truncate toward zero. The truncated
  value must fit the destination type. Float32 writes round to float32. This
  first API does not define wrapping integer stores or saturation.
- Indices must be finite integers representable as signed 64-bit offsets on the
  currently supported native targets. The complete access must designate live,
  correctly aligned, initialized storage for reads, and writable storage for
  writes. These are caller obligations; there is no bounds or lifetime check.
  Negative indices are valid only when they still designate an element of the
  same allocation. Invalid accesses and out-of-range integer conversions have
  no portable behavior promised by this slice.
- `const alias = p` copies the address. It does not copy the elements, transfer
  ownership, retain the pointee, or free anything. Aliases may observe each
  other's writes, including writes performed inside foreign calls.
- Compound assignments and increments use the existing TS assignment lowering:
  the receiver and index are evaluated once. Native memory width is explicit in
  HIR; numeric specialization cannot silently turn a byte load into a double
  load. The verifier rejects disagreements.
- Native pointer bits never pass through `number`, managed array helpers, or
  reference counting. Phantom brand reads, object-based pointer construction,
  casts between pointee identities, boxing into `unknown`, and native pointers
  in ordinary TS arrays remain refused. Node-API does not marshal these pointers.
- This slice supports ordinary scalar memory, not atomic or volatile accesses.
  No new runtime helper or runtime object header is introduced.

## Direction for the next executable slices

1. **Native aggregates and addressable storage.** Use a real synchronous I/O
   example to settle `Struct`, inline fields, fixed arrays, `sizeof`, alignment,
   and address-of together. Keep C payload layout separate from allocation and
   lifetime. Preserve TS aliasing for ordinary assignment; explicitly define
   copy operations and spread behavior before lowering either.
2. **Allocation and foreign declarations.** Exercise allocation failure,
   byte-count overflow, alignment, `void *`, and const-qualified C pointers.
   Prefer a typed `malloc` that keeps malloc's byte-count convention over a new
   allocation vocabulary. Derive declarations/layouts from actual C headers;
   do not maintain guessed ABI copies. The typed malloc API is not implemented.
3. **Callbacks, then retained asynchronous I/O.** Let application code use TS
   callback syntax, while binding information specifies the C function pointer,
   context, retention, thread, and exception contract. Prove synchronous callback
   behavior first. A retained callback must have explicit lifetime and cleanup
   even before ResourceFlow exists; capturing closures cannot be reinterpreted
   as bare C function pointers.
4. **ResourceFlow.** Add checked ownership, borrowing, escape, and cleanup facts
   over those operations. Keep unknown facts distinct from proved absence of
   mutation or escape. Introduce the ownership vocabulary together with its
   enforcement, not as an unenforced promise in type declarations.

These are design directions, not exported APIs. Each slice should include a real
C consumer and a failure control before this document claims it works. Revise
syntax from the examples; avoid compatibility layers for abandoned proposals.
