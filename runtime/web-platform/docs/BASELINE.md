# Integration baseline

## Inputs

- NTS implementation-start commit: `31f15a0d87ecc6d20640bec73dba0563d31b4894`.
- Governing contract: `docs/web-platform-integration-plan.md` at that commit.
- External source directory:
  `/home/akisarou/Projects/nts-web-platform-integration/runtime/web-platform`.
- External provenance snapshot recorded by the delivery:
  `bf5a6824c9bfd76fb3a30006fc4fea0665fe25dd`.
- SHA-256 of the delivered `MANIFEST.sha256`:
  `151f06d8d3dac257f7637b9e754bc9b6ce1a5b4844aa932a9d742b2cd37a5747`.

`sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256` passed for all 77 delivered files before import. The
mechanical copy of the 29 shared TypeScript algorithm files was checked byte-for-byte
against the delivery before repository formatting and the reviewed realm removal
were applied. `src/realm.ts` and the old barrel that exported it were intentionally
omitted. Android source is owned and imported by the JVM session; it is not copied
through the Node lane.

The original manifest, provenance, claims, and raw host evidence are retained under
`docs/external`. Their paths describe the external archive, not the layout of the
integrated tree.

## Reproduced Node-host evidence

These commands were run unchanged in the external source directory on 2026-09-06,
using Node `v24.20.0` and the delivery's TypeScript `5.8.3` / `@types/node` `25.1.0`.
Dependencies were installed with `npm install --ignore-scripts --no-package-lock`;
the source manifest remained unchanged.

| Command                 | Result                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run check`         | pass                                                   |
| `npm run audit`         | 31 shared TypeScript files, zero structural violations |
| `npm test`              | 80/80 pass, zero skipped                               |
| `npm run test:upstream` | expected nonzero exit; 8/9 pass                        |

The visible WPT failure remains the dictionary initializer in
`headers-normalize.any.js`: `TypeError: entries is not iterable`. It is not converted
to a pass. These are Node-host tests of the delivered source, not compiled NTS or
mobile-provider evidence.

The repository toolchain at start is TypeScript `7.0.2`, `@types/node` `24.13.3`,
and Node `v24.20.0`. The integrated project uses those repository versions rather
than retaining the delivery's package-local versions.

## Compiler baseline

The signed integration contract records 179 primary lowering refusals, 52 cascades,
and zero additional JVM-backend refusals for the delivered shared source with the
synthetic realm entry excluded. Including `realm.ts` produces invalid HIR with
`BrokenBase` for `RealmRequest -> Request` and `RealmResponse -> Response`.

After importing the 29 shared files, removing the subclass-injection hooks used only
by the rejected realm design, and making the new root project authoritative, this
command completed without invalid HIR:

```sh
NTS_TSGO="$PWD/target/tsgo" NTS_BACKEND=jvm \
  ./target/release/nts check runtime/web-platform/tsconfig.json
```

It reported 178 primary lowering refusals, 52 cascades, and zero `NTS4xxx`
JVM-backend refusals. This is the implementation-start refusal baseline. A refusal is
not counted as implementation progress, and an exit-zero `check` does not mean the
source can execute: the command reported that no exported scalar function was
available to run. Diagnostics remain grouped by underlying feature as the governing
plan requires.

An earlier temporary exclusion config in the external directory still reached
`realm.ts` despite TypeScript's resolved file list excluding it. That invocation is
not used as evidence. The canonical root project removes the rejected file rather
than relying on an exclusion, and no source workaround was introduced.

## Integrated Node-host evidence

The ordinary-Node provider and its host tests live under
`tooling/conformance/web-platform`, not under the shared runtime. This is deliberate:
the provider imports Node TCP, TLS, timer, random and compression primitives and is
host-level conformance infrastructure. It is neither the native Node-compatible
provider under `runtime/node` nor an implementation used by the mobile targets.

At the initial integrated tree, using the repository's TypeScript `7.0.2`, Node
declarations `24.13.3`, and Node `v24.20.0`:

| Command                                                   | Result                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `tooling/conformance/web-platform/check.sh`               | 80/80 pass, zero skipped |
| `node tooling/conformance/web-platform/test-upstream.mjs` | 9/9 pass                 |

The 80-test corpus is adapted only where removal of the external synthetic realm
changed construction: it creates the same canonical `Request`, `Response`, and
`WebSocket` classes through an explicit test runtime. Host `fetch` and `WebSocket`
remain replaced by throwing values. The WPT fixtures are unchanged and hash-checked;
the integrated implementation now passes the previously failing dictionary
initializer without modifying the upstream test.

## Current integration evidence

At `9779ffb`, the repository TypeScript build passes, the Node-host suite passes
98/98 with zero skipped, and the unchanged WPT slice passes 39/39. The additional
local cases cover protocol parsing, Web IDL conversion, MIME/body behavior,
cancellation, pool shutdown, TLS, canonical event initialization, and Blob
view/slice behavior; they do not turn host execution into evidence for a compiled
provider.

The WPT expansion reuses five complete FileAPI fixtures and their support script
from Node's existing pinned WPT checkout instead of creating another source copy.
The manifest verifies Node's FileAPI revision and every consumed Git blob before
execution. These fixtures cover `Blob.arrayBuffer()`, `Blob.bytes()`, `Blob.text()`,
fresh result identity, concurrent reads, and slice overflow. The complete
`Blob-slice.any.js` file is not in this applicable slice because it mixes those
behaviors with calls rejected by the TypeScript API itself, including `null` for a
`string` parameter and numbers in `BlobPart[]`. Fractional Web IDL slice conversion,
view copying, and immutability therefore remain focused typed differential tests;
they are not substitutes for an otherwise applicable whole upstream file.

The WPT slice also consumes the complete unchanged
`streams/readable-streams/floating-point-total-queue-size.any.js` fixture from
Node's pinned Streams checkout. Its four cases preserve the specification's exact
double-precision queue arithmetic: subtraction clamps a negative total to zero but
does not erase a small positive residue merely because the queue became empty. The
manifest verifies the independent Streams revision and the fixture's Git blob.

`tooling/conformance/web-platform/check.sh` performs one fresh host emit before both
the local and upstream suites. Direct execution of `test-upstream.mjs` performs its
own emit. This prevents stale generated JavaScript from making an upstream run look
green: an intentional `Blob.text()` sabotage produced eight awaited failures and a
nonzero exit after the fresh emit.

The shared source now uses `Promise.withResolvers()` directly instead of retaining
the external `Deferred` substitute. At `0304954`, the NTS check reports 186 primary
lowering refusals, 40 cascades, and zero `NTS4xxx` JVM-backend refusals. Seventy-three
emitted primary messages mention an unrepresentable `PromiseWithResolvers` property;
that count includes repeated specialized layouts and is one compiler/runtime feature
blocker, not 73 independent missing features. The final-form source remains in place
while that prerequisite is implemented.

At `1b91c18`, after the canonical Blob began accepting every `ArrayBufferView` and
using final Web IDL `[Clamp] long long` slice conversion, the same command reports
187 primary lowering refusals, 38 cascades, zero `NTS4xxx` JVM-backend refusals, and
no invalid HIR. That was the Blob integration baseline. The changed
count reflects intended source reaching a different diagnostic frontier; it is not
itself progress or regression.

At `d79e9e7`, the production HTTP/1 parser replaced regular-expression status and
`Content-Length` parsing, generic `Number.parseInt`, comma-list callbacks, and a
temporary `Headers` object per wire field with explicit bounded parsing. The live
check reports 183 primary refusals, 39 cascades, zero JVM-backend refusals, and no
invalid HIR. Four primary messages disappeared while one additional dependent path
became reachable; this is a changed diagnostic frontier caused by the intended
parser architecture, not evidence that four general language features were closed.

At `9779ffb`, the default readable-stream state machine uses a head-indexed pending
read queue rather than quadratic `Array.shift()` delivery. Strategy size callbacks
are invoked without an accidental stream receiver, tee branches use the standard
one-chunk demand, and source close/error is observed even when no branch currently
has a read pending. A branch canceled before its source errors now fulfills its
cancellation promise while the active branch receives the source error. The
original tee and Fetch-transfer streams deliberately remain locked after terminal
state, matching Node; releasing those readers as cleanup is observably wrong. The
live NTS check reports 195 primary refusals, 39 cascades, zero JVM-backend refusals,
and no invalid HIR. As above, the changed refusal count is a diagnostic frontier
for final-form source, not a completed-feature count.

At `2112af4`, Node URL percent decoding uses the canonical shared UTF-8 writer and
both `URL` and `URLSearchParams` use the shared typed scalar-value-string
normalizer. Untyped JavaScript coercion remains explicit at public Node boundaries;
passing a `symbol` still throws instead of slipping through a TypeScript annotation.
The Node URL suite passes 44/44 applicable files with three precisely documented
Section 13 exclusions, and the pinned URL WPT runner passes 892/892. `nts emit-c`
for the URL project exits successfully, and the HIR verifies all 292 functions left
after pruning; 212 constructs in the wider imported dependency graph remain refused
and are not claimed as implemented. The complete URL source directory was also
normalized with the repository formatter rather than leaving mixed imported style.

At `2bda8af`, `TextEncoder.encodeInto()` no longer carries a second UTF-8 state
machine. The canonical bounded writer optionally fills the progress object that
`encodeInto()` must return, while its ordinary Node Buffer and URL callers retain a
number return and allocate no progress object. A mutation forcing the consumed
code-unit count to zero makes the focused differential fail with `{ read: 0,
written: 1 }` versus `{ read: 1, written: 1 }`. The local Node-host suite passes
99/99. Two complete unchanged Encoding WPT files from Node's pinned checkout add
thirteen surrogate/default-input cases, bringing the immutable WPT slice to 52/52;
the VM context explicitly installs the integrated `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder`,
not the host globals. The live NTS check reports 196 primary refusals, 40 cascades,
zero JVM-backend refusals, and no invalid HIR. The additional diagnostics are the
current final-source frontier, not evidence of either implemented features or a
compiler regression.

The common C runtime now has an `NtsEnvironment` and scoped current-environment ABI,
but shared TypeScript cannot yet obtain its environment-owned Web dependencies.
Consequently the explicit context arguments still visible on `Request`, `Response`,
`WebSocket`, and `AbortSignal.timeout` are transitional and are not the intended
public signatures. Removing them requires the typed current-environment/constructor
entry seam; process-global mutable state is not an acceptable substitute.

At `2c92fae`, the non-tree `EventTarget` implements the DOM listener options that
affect standalone networking semantics: an already-aborted signal prevents
registration, later abort removes the exact listener, duplicate registration does
not let a second signal take ownership of the original listener, and passive
listeners cannot cancel an event. Removal and one-shot delivery both detach the
abort algorithm, and post-dispatch compaction is linear rather than repeated array
splicing. The Node-host suite passes 100/100 and the unchanged WPT slice remains
52/52. A mutation that retained the listener after signal abort failed the focused
differential with two calls where Node and the implementation require one. The live
NTS check reports 198 primary refusals, 41 cascades, zero JVM-backend refusals, and
no invalid HIR; this is another final-source frontier, not a claim that its language
dependencies are implemented.
